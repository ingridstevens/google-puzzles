This code snippet was created as an exercise in Python that is provided by Google in their Foobar Challenge. For more context on what the Foobar Challenge is and how alternative solutions could be written, [please read this article](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/1512/how-to-create-a-dictionary-of-the-reversed-alphabet-to-encode-and-decode-text-with-javascript)

Challenge 1 is a simple decryption function that looks for lowercase letters and replaces them with the "opposite" letter. For example, 'a' is replaced with 'z' and 'b' becomes 'y'.

If you want to use my code to run this in your local environment, please feel free to run the sample: 

```solution("wrw blf hvv ozhg mrtsg'h vkrhlwv?")``` 
which decrypts to "did you see last night's episode?"
