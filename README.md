This code snippet was created as an exercise in Python that is provided by Google. 

Challenge 1 is a simple decryption function that looks for lowercase letters and replaces them with the "opposite" letter. For example, 'a' is replaced with 'z' and 'b' becomes 'y'.

In the code, the example to run is: solution("wrw blf hvv ozhg mrtsg'h vkrhlwv?") which decrypts to "did you see last night's episode?"
